# Python-Projects
This repo is my project expo from beginner to advanced 📈 to explore more and more real world scenarios and gain experiences.

PROJECT 1 :
NUMBER GUESSING GAME 
Complexities:   Time Complexity = O(log N)
                Space Complexity = O(1)
1.If user guesses randomly → behaves like linear search → O(N)
2.If guesses strategically (binary search style) → O(log N)
3.Space complexity is constant → O(1)
4.Efficiency depends on guess strategy, not just code
